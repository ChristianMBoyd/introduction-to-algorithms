\subsection{Algorithms as a technology}

\subsubsection{}
    An streaming application requires algorithms to unencode and display the video data streams it receives.

\subsubsection{}
    If a computing environment run insertion sort in $8n^2$ steps and merge sort in $64n\log n$ steps and all other technicalities can be ignored, then insertion sort will out-perform the merge sort when
    \begin{equation}
        8n^2 < 64 n \log n
        \implies 
        \frac{n}{\log n} < 8 \,\,\,.
    \end{equation}
    Since $\log 10 = 1$, it's clear that $n<10$.  Plotting this, the crossing happens near $n\approx6.5$, so that it holds only for $2\le n \le 6$ since $n=1$ is trivial.

\subsubsection{}
    We want to identify the first integer $n$ where
    \begin{equation}
        100n^2 < 2^n \implies 100 < \frac{2^n}{n^2} \,\,\,.
    \end{equation}
    These curves cross near $n\approx14.3$, so that the smallest integer value satisfying the condition is $n=15$.
