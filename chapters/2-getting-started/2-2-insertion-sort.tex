\subsection{Insertion sort}

\subsubsection{}
    For the input array $[31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58]$, the insertion sort would progressively build the sorted list as follows.
    \begin{eqnarray}
        \nonumber
        [31] &\to& [31, 41] \to [31, 41, 59] \to [26, 31, 41, 59] 
        \\
        &\to& [26, 31, 41, 41, 59] \to [26, 31, 41, 41, 58, 59]
    \end{eqnarray}
